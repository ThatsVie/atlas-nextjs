## Task 1: App Routing  

### **Learning Objective:**  
- Learn to create a multi-page React application using the **App Router** in Next.js.  

### **Resources:**  
- **[Next.js App Router](https://atlas-jswank.github.io/blog/next-js-routing/)** ‚Äì Overview of the Next.js routing system.  
- **[Routing Fundamentals](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing)** ‚Äì Official Next.js documentation for routing.  

### **Requirements & Implementation Plan**  

#### **Creating the Required Routes**  
The following routes were implemented in the application:

- **`/`**: Homepage for non-logged-in users
- **`/about`**: "About Us" page
- **`/ui`**: Homepage after user login
- **`/ui/topics/:id`**: Displays questions related to a specific topic
- **`/ui/topics/new`**: Form for creating a new topic

#### **Setting Up a Shared Layout for `/ui/*` Routes**  
- Added a sidebar to all `/ui/*` pages using `layout.tsx` to maintain a consistent UI.

#### **Implementing a Loading Page**  
- Introduced a skeleton loader that appears while a `/ui/*` page is loading.

#### **Updating Navigation for Performance**  
- Replaced all `<a>` elements with `<Link>` components from Next.js to enable client-side navigation and improve performance.


### **What I Did**  

#### **Implemented the Required Pages & Layout**
The following files were created:
  
- **Homepage (`/`)**: `app/page.tsx`
- **About Page (`/about`)**: `app/about/page.tsx`
- **User Interface Home (`/ui`)**: `app/ui/page.tsx`
- **Topic Page (`/ui/topics/:id`)**: `app/ui/topics/[id]/page.tsx`
- **New Topic Form (`/ui/topics/new`)**: `app/ui/topics/new/page.tsx`
  
#### **Created a Shared Layout for `/ui/*`**
- Defined `app/ui/layout.tsx` to wrap all `/ui/*` pages with a sidebar.

#### **Implemented a Loading Skeleton**
- Added `app/ui/loading.tsx` to display a skeleton while loading.

#### **Updated Navigation with `<Link>` Components**
- Used `next/link` for all navigation links to ensure smooth, client-side transitions.

### **Result:**  
- Routing is correctly set up.
- A shared layout exists for `/ui/*`.
- Skeleton loading page is implemented.
- All `<a>` tags have been replaced with `<Link>` components.

## Task 2: Setup Database  

### **Learning Objective:**  
- Learn to set up a PostgreSQL database on Vercel and connect it to a Next.js application.  

### **Resources:**  
- **[Next.js Database Setup](https://atlas-jswank.github.io/blog/next-js-database/)** ‚Äì Guide for setting up and integrating a database.  

### **What I Did**  

#### **Step 1: Set Up a PostgreSQL Database on Vercel**  
- Created a new project in Vercel and linked it to the GitHub repository.  
- Clicked on the **Storage** tab and created a new PostgreSQL database.  
- Copied the **environment variables** provided by Vercel for database access.  

#### **Step 2: Configure Local Environment**  
- Created a `.env.local` file in the project root.  
- Pasted the database connection details from Vercel into `.env.local`.  
- Ensured `.env.local` was added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.  

#### **Step 3: Seed the Database**  
- Started the development server using:  
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```  
- Opened `http://localhost:3000/seed` in a browser to initialize the database.  
- Confirmed the message **"Database seeded successfully"** appeared.  

#### **Step 4: Verify Database in Neon Console (Vercel)**  
- Opened **Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clicked on the Database Name** (Neon).  
- Used the **Tables** tab in Neon to view `users`, `topics`, and `questions`.  
- Confirmed that the seed data was present and correctly populated in the database.  


### **Result**  
- PostgreSQL database is successfully set up and accessible.  
- `.env.local` file contains correct database credentials.  
- Tables and initial data are present in the database.  
- The Next.js application is connected to the database and can fetch stored data.

## Task 3: Data Fetching  

### **Learning Objective:**  
- Learn to display data from the database using **React Server Components (RSC)**.  

### **Resources:**  
- **[Next.js Data Fetching](https://atlas-jswank.github.io/blog/next-js-data-fetching/)** ‚Äì Guide for fetching and displaying data in Next.js.  

### **What I Did**  

#### **Step 1: Fetch and Display Topics in the Sidebar**  
- Updated **`TopicLinks.tsx`** to fetch topics from the database and display them in the sidebar.  
- Used `fetchTopics()` from `lib/data.ts` to retrieve the topics from the database.  
- Clicking on a topic navigates to `/ui/topics/:id`, where topic-specific questions are displayed.  

#### **Step 2: Display Topics on the `/ui` Page**  
- Updated **`app/ui/page.tsx`** to display the full list of topics retrieved from the database.  
- Clicking on a topic from this page also redirects to `/ui/topics/:id`.  

#### **Step 3: Fetch and Display Questions for Each Topic**  
- Implemented **`app/ui/topics/[id]/page.tsx`** to display questions related to the selected topic.  
- Used `fetchTopic(id)` and `fetchQuestions(id)` from `lib/data.ts` to get topic details and its associated questions.  
- Added a **"Topic Not Found"** fallback if an invalid topic ID is accessed.  


### **Result**  
- Topics now appear in the **sidebar** and on the `/ui` page.  
- Clicking a topic **navigates to the topic page** where questions are displayed.  
- Data fetching from the database using **React Server Components (RSC)** is working as expected.  
- Some issues were only fully resolved after completing authentication in later tasks.

## Task 4: Server Actions  

### **Learning Objective**  
- Learn to perform server-side actions in Next.js using **React Server Actions**.  

### **Resources**  
- **[Next.js Server Actions](https://atlas-jswank.github.io/blog/next-js-server-actions/)** ‚Äì Overview of server actions in Next.js.  
- **[React Server Actions](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions)** ‚Äì Official React documentation on server functions.  

### **What I Did**  

#### **Step 1: Add a Form to Create New Topics**  
- Implemented a form on `/ui/topics/new` where users can create a new topic.  
- The topic should appear in both the **sidebar** and **topics list** on `/ui`.  


#### **Step 2: Implement Server Action to Add Topics**  
- Created a **server action** to insert a topic into the database.  
- Used `insertTopic` function from `lib/data.ts` to perform the database operation.  
- Called `revalidatePath()` to refresh the page and reflect new topics immediately.  
- Updated the **Create Topic Form** component to use the new server action.  


#### **Step 3: Implement Server Action for Asking Questions**  
- Allowed users to ask questions in **`/ui/topics/:id`**.  
- Added a hidden input field in the form to **track the topic ID**.  
- Integrated the function into the **AskQuestion** component.  


#### **Step 4: Implement Voting Functionality**  
- Allowed users to upvote questions by clicking a thumbs-up button.  
- Updated the **Vote Button** component to call the server action.  


### **Result**  
- Users can **add topics**, which now appear in the sidebar and topics list.  
- Users can **ask questions**, which immediately update on the topic page.  
- Users can **upvote questions**, and the vote count updates dynamically.  

This implementation successfully integrates **server actions** for performing database operations without requiring traditional API routes.

## Task 5: Authentication

### **Learning Objective**  
- Learn to protect the application with a login page.  

### **Resources**  
- **[Next JS Authentication Blog](https://atlas-jswank.github.io/blog/next-js-authentication/)** ‚Äì Step-by-step blog tutorial.  
- **[Handling Sign in and Sign out](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/session-management/login?framework=next-js)** ‚Äì Official documentation on authentication session management.  



### **What I Did**  

#### **Step 1: Setup Auth.js Handler**  
- Created a new authentication handler in `auth.ts`.  
- Integrated NextAuth with a **Credentials Provider** for email/password authentication.  

#### **Step 2: Add Custom authorize Method**  
- Implemented a method to verify user credentials.  
- Added `bcryptjs` to compare passwords securely.  

#### **Step 3: Add authorized Callback**  
- Implemented a callback to restrict access to authenticated users.  

#### **Step 4: Implement Authentication Middleware**  
- Created `middleware.ts` to enforce authentication rules.  

#### **Step 5: Add Authentication API Routes**  
- Created `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` to handle authentication API endpoints.  

#### **Step 6: Generate and Set Authentication Secret**  
- Ran the following command to generate a secret key:  
  ```bash
  npx auth secret
  ```  
- Initially, I added `AUTH_SECRET` to the `.env.local` file. However, I later changed it to `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` for the following reasons:  
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is the officially recommended variable name for NextAuth.js, ensuring compatibility with future updates.  
  - It aligns with best practices outlined in the NextAuth.js documentation, making it easier to integrate with authentication providers and maintain consistency.  

#### **Step 7: Implement Login Action**  
- Updated the login button in `app/page.tsx` to trigger the sign-in action.  

#### **Step 8: Implement Logout Action**  
- Updated the sign-out button in `components/SignOutButton.tsx`.  


### **Result**  
- Users can now **log in** and **log out** securely.  
- Unauthenticated users are **redirected to the login page** when trying to access `/ui/*` pages.  
- The application enforces **session-based authentication** with Auth.js.  
- The login button on the homepage **redirects to the login page**.  
- The sign-out button in the sidebar **logs users out and redirects them to the homepage**.
