- Updated **`TopicLinks.tsx`** to fetch topics from the database and display them in the sidebar.
- Used `fetchTopics()` from `lib/data.ts` to retrieve the topics from the database.
- Clicking on a topic navigates to `/ui/topics/:id`, where topic-specific questions are displayed.

#### **Step 2: Display Topics on the `/ui` Page**

- Updated **`app/ui/page.tsx`** to display the full list of topics retrieved from the database.
- Clicking on a topic from this page also redirects to `/ui/topics/:id`.

#### **Step 3: Fetch and Display Questions for Each Topic**

- Implemented **`app/ui/topics/[id]/page.tsx`** to display questions related to the selected topic.
- Used `fetchTopic(id)` and `fetchQuestions(id)` from `lib/data.ts` to get topic details and its associated questions.
- Added a **"Topic Not Found"** fallback if an invalid topic ID is accessed.

### **Result**

- Topics now appear in the **sidebar** and on the `/ui` page.
- Clicking a topic **navigates to the topic page** where questions are displayed.
- Data fetching from the database using **React Server Components (RSC)** is working as expected.
- Some issues were only fully resolved after completing authentication in later tasks.

---

## Task 4: Server Actions

### **Learning Objective**

- The topic should appear in both the **sidebar** and **topics list** on `/ui`.

#### **Step 2: Implement Server Action to Add Topics**

- Created a **server action** to insert a topic into the database.
- Used `insertTopic` function from `lib/data.ts` to perform the database operation.
- Called `revalidatePath()` to refresh the page and reflect new topics immediately.
- Updated the **Create Topic Form** component to use the new server action.

#### **Step 3: Implement Server Action for Asking Questions**

- Allowed users to ask questions in **`/ui/topics/:id`**.
- Added a hidden input field in the form to **track the topic ID**.
- Integrated the function into the **AskQuestion** component.

#### **Step 4: Implement Voting Functionality**

- Allowed users to upvote questions by clicking a thumbs-up button.
- Updated the **Vote Button** component to call the server action.

### **Result**

- Users can **add topics**, which now appear in the sidebar and topics list.
- Users can **ask questions**, which immediately update on the topic page.
- Users can **upvote questions**, and the vote count updates dynamically.

This implementation successfully integrates **server actions** for performing database operations without requiring traditional API routes.

#### **Step 6: Generate and Set Authentication Secret**

- Ran the following command to generate a secret key:
  ```bash
  npx auth secret
  ```
- Initially, I added `AUTH_SECRET` to the `.env.local` file. However, I later changed it to `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` for the following reasons:
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is the officially recommended variable name for NextAuth.js, ensuring compatibility with future updates.
  - It aligns with best practices outlined in the NextAuth.js documentation, making it easier to integrate with authentication providers and maintain consistency.
